	<h1>Ride Sharing and CO2 Emissions: A Project Assessment and Proposal for Sustainability</h1>
	</center>

	<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a major contributor to climate change and global warming. They are produced by the burning of fossil 
fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which are used to power transportation,electricity generation, and other activities.Ride pooling, also known as carpooling, is a form of transportation in which multiple passengers share a ride in a single vehicle. This can help reduce the number of vehicles on the road, which in turn reduces CO2 emissions by reducing the total distance traveled by vehicles. By sharing a ride, passengers can reduce the number of trips taken, which can lead to lower fuel consumption and fewer emissions per person.</p>
